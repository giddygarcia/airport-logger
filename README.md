# Airport Logger
### Overview  
This Airport Logger was developed using Ruby on Rails by making a **Models-Views-Controllers framework from scratch, essentially learning how to make a Rails Scaffold manually.**
  
The web application is an online database made with:
- HTML  
- CSS (minimal Bootstrap included)  
- JavaScript (modals and errors)  
   
It was designed to emulate the tracking of planes in an airport along with the particulars of each (Flight capacity, times, etc.)  
The application comes with complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.  
  
Screenshots of the website application in operation are attached in the folder 'Screenshots'  
  
### Software Versions
- Ruby 2.6.3
- Rails 5.2.3
- Gem 3.0.3

### Execution instructions
